Up-to-date summary of all the data science challenges I have completed so far.
<!--more-->

### My projects so far include:
#### Statistical modelling
* [Machine Learning with linear regression](https://github.com/sarahleejane/Linear-Regression-in-Octave) - coded vectorized cost function, gradient descent function and normalized equation function for regression predictions in Octave.
* [Machine Learning with logistic regression](https://github.com/sarahleejane/Logistic-Regression-in-Octave) - used advanced optimization functions to calculate regularized cost function and implement gradient descent for classification predictions in Octave.
* [Machine Learning with neural networks](https://github.com/sarahleejane/Neural-Networks-in-Octave) - coded feedforward, regularized cost function and backpropogation for classification predictions in Octave.
* Predictive modelling - created a survival prediction model for Titanic passengers in R.
* [Twitter tweet analysis](https://github.com/sarahleejane/Tweet-Sentiment) - deduced the happiest U.S. State by establishing the sentiment and location of Twitter tweets in Python
* Fraud model for [Zopa](http://www.zopa.com/) - designed model to detect fraudulent applications.

#### Analytics
* [Remarketing insights](https://github.com/sarahleejane/AnyRoad-Projects) for [AnyRoad](https://www.anyroad.com/) - designed and implemented remarketing strategies using customer segmentation in R, and Google Analytics.
* AB testing for [AnyRoad](https://www.anyroad.com/) - Optimized page features using Google Analytics.
* Conversion optimisation with Splunk for [Zopa](http://www.zopa.com/) - combined Splunk and relational database data to aggregate end-to-end user journeys per device type.

#### Data visualisation
* Company health check dashboard [Zopa](http://www.zopa.com/) - shows key company metrics, built in Flask and generates daily email.
* Team progress visualisation at [Zopa](http://www.zopa.com/) - live view of progress per team member, built in Flask.

#### Data infrastructure
* [SQL fundamentals](https://github.com/sarahleejane/Playing-SQL) - wrote complex queries to enable keyword searches and matrix multiplication in SQL.
* [MapReduce](https://github.com/sarahleejane/MapReduce-Basics) - adopted Map and Reduce functions to invert indices, create relational joins and perform social network analysis in Python.
* Relational database design - designed project databases using class diagrams, relation schemes and normal forms.
* Data landscape map at [Zopa](http://www.zopa.com/) - mapped the different data themes of the company.
