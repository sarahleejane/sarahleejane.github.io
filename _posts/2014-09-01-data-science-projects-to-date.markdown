An overview of the data science projects I have completed both inside and outside of work.
<!--more-->

### My projects so far include:

#### Statistical modelling
* Fraud model for [Zopa](http://www.zopa.com/) - designed model to detect fraudulent applications.
* Propensity modelling [Zopa](http://www.zopa.com/) - designed model to predict certain customer behaviours.
* [Regression algorithm](https://github.com/sarahleejane/Linear-Regression-in-Octave) - coded vectorized cost function, gradient descent function and normalized equation function for regression and classification predictions in Octave.
* [Neural network algorithm](https://github.com/sarahleejane/Neural-Networks-in-Octave) - coded feedforward, regularized cost function and backpropogation for classification predictions in Octave.
* Predictive modelling - created a survival prediction model for Titanic passengers in R.
* [Twitter tweet analysis](https://github.com/sarahleejane/Tweet-Sentiment) - deduced the happiest U.S. State by establishing the sentiment and location of Twitter tweets in Python

#### Analytics
* Conversion optimisation with Splunk for [Zopa](http://www.zopa.com/) - combined Splunk and SQL data to aggregate end-to-end user journeys per device type.
* Email campaign [Zopa](http://www.zopa.com/) - campaign design, implementation and success analysis.
* [Remarketing insights](https://github.com/sarahleejane/AnyRoad-Projects) for [AnyRoad](https://www.anyroad.com/) - designed and implemented remarketing strategies using customer segmentation in R, and Google Analytics.
* AB testing for [AnyRoad](https://www.anyroad.com/) - Optimized page features using Google Analytics.

#### Data visualisation
* Company health check dashboard [Zopa](http://www.zopa.com/) - shows key company metrics, built in Flask and generates daily email.
* Team progress visualisation at [Zopa](http://www.zopa.com/) - live view of progress per team member, built in Flask and fed via SQL.

#### Data infrastructure
* Data landscape map at [Zopa](http://www.zopa.com/) - mapped the different data themes of the company.
* [MapReduce](https://github.com/sarahleejane/MapReduce-Basics) - adopted Map and Reduce functions to invert indices, create relational joins and perform social network analysis in Python.
* Relational database design - designed project database structure using class diagrams, relation schemes and normal forms.
